# Gleitzsch (in Kotlin)

I've recently begun learning Kotlin and, as part of this journey, I'm attempting to reimplement my previous Python-based project, [Gleitzsch](https://github.com/kirilenkobm/gleitzsch).
This tool is designed to introduce glitch artifacts to images through the use of MP3 compression.
Please note, this requires the LAME MP3 encoder.
